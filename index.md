Greetings. I am not sure how exactly I will use GitHub and GitHub Pages with my intended project, but I will be developing a website for an upcoming club for my school to account for an extricurricular activity for that resume clout. I hope to learn more about HTML, CSS, and JS. Thanks for reading :)
